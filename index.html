This is basically a simple TicTacToe game you can play with your friends
I have put in a lot of time in this project. I hope this project demonstrates how much I've learned about jQuery
The computer will ask you if you want to go first (You enter X or O)
Then you select the slot you want to put in by clicking on the brown boxes.
The computer automatically recognize who is the winner by giving you a message
and by highlighting the winner's slots. The computer will also add a point to the winner's score.
You may reset the game by pressing the reset button, but this will not reset the score.
